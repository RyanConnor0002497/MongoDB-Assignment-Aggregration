Q1. 

Import the zips.json file into your MongoDB. Database name is "population" and 
collection name is "zipcodes".

Solution:- 

#To question 1

cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin"

C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin> mongoimport --jsonArray --db population --collection zipcodes --file E:\mongodb\zip.json

Q2. 

Atlanta Population

1. use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA.
2. use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
3. use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
4. use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.

Solution:-

#To question 2.1

db.zipcodes.find({$and:[{"city":"ATLANTA"}, {"state":"GA"}]})

#To question 2.2

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match:{$and:[{"city":"ATLANTA"},{"state":"GA"}]}}]);

#To question 2.3

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"zipcode"},count:{$sum:1}}])

#To question 2.4



Q3. 

Populations By State

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state
2. sort the results by population, highest first
3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?

Solution:-

#To question 3.1

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group:{_id:{$sum:"pop"}}}])

#To question 3.2

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$sort:{pop:-1}}])

#To question 3.3

db.zipcodes.find().sort({pop:-1}).limit(3)

Q4. 

Populations by City

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' }
2. sort the results by population, highest first
3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?
4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?

Solution:-

#To question 4.1



#To question 4.2

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$sort:{pop:-1}}])

#To question 4.3

db.zipcodes.find().sort({pop:-1}).limit(3)

#To question 4.4

db.zipcodes.find({state:"Texas"}).sort({pop:-1}).limit(3)
